    <div><h3>Features</h3></div>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python and C++.
        It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. 
        Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services).
    Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
